# Get Started, Part 1: Orientation and setup

Welcome! We are excited you want to learn how to use Docker.

In this six-part tutorial, you will:

* Get set up and oriented, on this page.
* Build and run your first app
* Turn your app into a scaling service
* Span your service across multiple machines
* Add a visitor counter that persists data
* Deploy your swarm to production

The application itself is very simple so that you are not too distracted by what the code is doing. After all, the value of Docker is in how it can build, ship, and run applications; it’s totally agnostic as to what your application actually does.
